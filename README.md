# Driving_Test_Centres-Group-4

Project Overview

    This repository contains the code and data for a comprehensive analysis of UK driving test centers, focusing on factors affecting pass rates. Our research investigates the correlation between driving test pass rates and various environmental factors including road infrastructure, traffic conditions, and geographical location.

Key Features:

    Analysis of pass rates across different test centers
    Visualization of road features (roundabouts, junctions, dual carriageways)
    Correlation between COVID-19 traffic levels and pass rates
    Comparison between rural and urban test centers

Data Sources:
UK driving test center pass rates
OpenStreetMap data for road infrastructure
Traffic volume data before and during COVID-19 pandemic

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
Pandas
Matplotlib
NumPy
OpenPyXL
